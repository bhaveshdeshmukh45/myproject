            <p class="text">An adventure is an exciting or unusual experience. It may also be a bold, usually risky undertaking, with an uncertain outcome. Adventures may be activities with some potential for physical danger such as exploring, skydiving, mountain climbing, river rafting, or participating in extreme sports. The term also broadly refers to any enterprise that is potentially fraught with physical, financial, or psychological risk, such as a business venture, or other major life undertakings.

                Both man and trees are the two most essential parts of the big whole called life. God created trees as man’s life support system. Without trees, man’s life would be a dreary wasteland devoid of the promise and hope of life. Omniscient God knew man’s many survival needs, hence He created a living god called tree to help man live healthily, joyously, and rapturously.
